# PLSR-and-Magic-Data
Each folder contains the three .csv files and r code needed to predict chemistry from the MUX or SSCAN data. 
1. Water quality (WQ) data from grab samples at FCR, 2. Fingerpirnt (FP) data that overlaps with the WQ data, 
and 3. the complete timeseries that you want to predict over. 
The .rmd file in the 2020 folder walks through the PLSR process with lots of comments.
The TS_Predictions_2019 file are my chemistry predictions for FCR at 1.6m, which is formatted for use in FLARE.
